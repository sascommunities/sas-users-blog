This repository contains the code used in the [The Empirical Mode Decomposition for Handling Non-Stationary Time Series Paper and Blog post](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2023/05/16/empirical-mode-decomposition-non-stationary-time-series/)

In this example, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method analyzes Simulated West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Oil Prices. Specifically, the CALL EMD subroutine within the SAS/IML software performs the decomposition process. This technique will enables you to extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) from the data, which can then be used to uncover underlying trends, cycles, and other significant components present in the WTI oil price time series.
